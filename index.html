<p>
“Please add ability to enter CPK gift cards as a form of payment in the app.  
This would streamline paying as well.” - joe733</p>

<p>“It would be nice if they used a little bigger font.  It is too small currently” -johndoe99</p>

<p>“Finally mobile pay works but still can’t redeem pizza dough rewards through mobile pay.  
Something to work on I guess.” -Shripathi</p>

<p>“No menu prices on menu items.” -Fralupo</p>

<p>I additionally carried out User Experience Research by examining what people look for most 
frequently in restaurant applications.  According to Urban Taste Bud, the best restaurant 
apps are those that:
<ul>
	<li>Allow people to make reservations for free</li>
	<li>Get rewards points/dining credits through reservations</li>
	<li>Allow users to navigate menus in terms of their vegetarian, vegan, paleo, low carb, 
	and gluten-free options</li>
	<li>Arrange a delivery/pick-up</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-indent:2.0em">
Upon further research, I saw that the Starbucks app is often venerated for its 
user-friendliness and efficient capabilities.

Nonetheless, at the moment, the CPK app is hard to navigate, void of aesthetic,
 and has an extensive side bar with unnecessary tabs.

<br>
</div>

<p class="w3-center">
Redesign Concept</p>

<div class="w3-row-padding">
<div class="w3-col 18 m6">
  <p> I completely eliminated the sidebar seeing as it only worsens user experience.  
Instead, I placed the most important and in-demand features of a restaurant app at the very top.  
This way, someone can reserve a table at a given location, pay for an item, track CPK Rewards points, and place an order.  
The original New + Seasonal Tab mostly contained advertisements surrounding new products, so I placed that at the home page.</p>

  <p> The reserve space will immediately direct the user to a map--allowing them to look at nearby 
CPK locations based on the location that the app will track.  
At the moment, the “Locations” tab does not immediately open to a map--there is solely an input for a zip code.  
The CPK Rewards tab will introduce a completely new concept.  It will allow CPK Rewards to be administered electronically.  
Customers can gift CPK cards to one another and they can additionally get virtual CPK gift cards if they 
order online enough or accumulate enough points through restaurant visits.  
This will incentivize CPK Rewards to be used.</p>

  <p> The Place Order tab will additionally introduce a new concept.  Rather than simply opening to a “View Menu/Place Order” tab 
that links one to a location, the page will first open to cater towards the consumers’ needs, inquiring about any potential 
filters that the user may want to utilize before going straight to the menu.  The background is a pizza from CPK.  
The buttons will allow people to filter exactly what they are looking for.  </p>

Upon further inquiry, customers can look at the various ingredients that each one has to offer by clicking on the arrows

and add items to their cart.  After choosing the various items that one wants to order, consumers can click on “Review Cart” 
in order to get to the Place Order Interface 3.
“Review Cart” and “Pay” will take the user to the same place--a place where one can order before check out.  </p>

<p> I took to the App Store to carry out User Experience Research in order to identify how 
to ameliorate this application.   Most App reviews for the Express app had to do with software bugs,
 such as the application closing too frequently or freezing sporadically.  
 The only top comment regarding User Interface was a suggestion surrounding having a potential 
 “favorite” option so that consumers can examine what they may want to purchase, but 
 do not want to add to their cart just yet. I additionally examined other shopping 
 applications in the same industry (American fashion retail) that had higher app review ratings.

<p>
I added the favorite button, as per the suggestion of the reviewer.  
I also added a bag icon next to the favorite button in order to allow users to “quick shop,” 
or add the item in their bag without opening the full interface with the product.  
Additionally, I streamlined the process of getting to the side bar by placing all of these 
options at the very top of the application.  Likewise, I placed some of the most important 
aspects of an application--the store locator, trend snap, and express AR, at the bottom of the 
application so that they can be accessed at all times regardless of what the shopper is doing.  
This overall improves the user experience because there is a sense of the various capabilities 
within the application just from the first page.

<p class="w3-center">
Within Wellesley's Human-Computer Interaction course, I worked with three classmates to build a low-

could potentially serve the same purpose.</p>

<p> I interviewed students in order to complete user research.  I inquired with students about
what they looked for during office hours, what they would like to see in an office hours app, and what kind
of obstacles they face while attempting to attend office hours at the moment.  
I utilized Invision in order to design this app, modeling the design after what users 
would potentially look for during office hours: how to navigate the queue and communicate
with a professor or teacher's assistant.  
</p>

<p class="w3-center">

<p> The high-fidelity prototype was additionally designed with Invision.  After testing the low-fidelity

   <br>Inspired by my group project for CS220, this chatbot is designed 
  for Wellesley students 
who would like to attend office hours.  Students would use it in order to have a central 
resource for office hour information, given that office hour information is often sprawled 
across various syllabi, websites, and papers.  They would use it if they have an impending 
question or an upcoming problem set or test and they know that they would like to attend 
office hours at some point this week.  The prototype was created with Botsociety.

<h2 class="w3-center">Citizens' Re-entry App Design</h2>
<div style="padding:10px">
<p class="w3-center">
Within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Civic Media Lab, I created an early sketch
of a platform from my perspective as to what kind of app would be most useful for case managers 
aiding re-entering citizens.  This kind of platform is meant to reduce recidivism.</p>

<p class="w3-center">
User Research
</p>
I analyzed case studies, such as the AT&T Upskilling Initiative, Cognizant Reskilling and 
Upskilling, GE mid-career leadership programs, and FutureFit AI, ultimately coming to the 
conclusion that recidivism rates are successfully reduced through access to vocational 
education, proper healthcare, adequate residencies, and fulfilling employment opportunities.  
Thus, I created this app with the idea that case managers should organize how their clients 
are progressing in each of the aforementioned fields.  Capitalizing on the design principles of
white space, alignment, metaphors, and the proximity gestalt principle, the following app 
was created.

<p class="w3-center">
Initially inspired by the fembots of "Austin Powers" as well as Jacquemus's idea of a tiny 
purse, I created this dress and purse from scratch utilizing two square yards of pink satin, two yards 
of white fur, an old white sports t-shirt, pink latex, a hot glue gun, and a sewing machine.  This
dress was debuted at Babson's Weissman Foundry fashion show.  Pictures of the creation, consequent 
fashion show debut, and the final look on myself are below.</p>
